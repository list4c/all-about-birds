One of the greatest tips for bird watchers is remain silent and try to make as little noise as possible. Equally important is our way of moving -- we should move gently, so as not to startle the bird. The next important part is how we dress. Bright colours are more visible to the birds, therefore we should avoid them to be less conspicuous. Darker colours that blend with the background are recommended, i.e. camouflage fabrics like the ones worn by soldiers.
